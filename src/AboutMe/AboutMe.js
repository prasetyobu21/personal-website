                    My name is Prasetyo Budi Utomo, but you can call me Tyo. I am a UX Designer, Graphic Designer, Web and Android Developer. I take computer science major on my college in Bakrie University, and know I do my thesis for me to graduate from university. I like playing games and watching movies. I like story driven games like Assassins Creed series, which is my favorite title of game, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. Beside that, I like some competitive FPS games like Valorant, CSGO, and Rainbow Six Siege. Sometimes I livestream on my twitch when I play. Now I focusing on UX design, android, and web development for my career. But isnâ€™t close the other opportunity, such as graphic design or logo design for my side job.
